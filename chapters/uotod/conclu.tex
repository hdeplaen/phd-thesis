\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Throughout the paper, we showed both theoretically and experimentally how \emph{Unbalanced Optimal Transport} unifies the \emph{Hungarian algorithm}, matching each ground truth object to the best prediction and each prediction to the best ground truth, with or without threshold. 

Experimentally, using OT and Unbalanced OT with entropic regularization is on par with the state-of-the-art for DETR, Deformable DETR and SSD. Moreover, we showed that entropic regularization lets DETR converge faster on the Color Boxes dataset and that parameter $\tau_2$ offers better control of the precision-recall trade-off. Finally, we showed that the \emph{scaling algorithms} compute large numbers of matches faster than the Hungarian algorithm.

\subsubsection{Limitations and Future Work} The convergence improvement of the regularized OT formulation compared to bipartite matching seems to hold only for DETR and on small-scale datasets. Further investigations may include Wasserstein-based matching costs for a further unification of the theory and the reduction of the entropy with time, as it seems to boost convergence only in early phases, but not in fine-tuning.
